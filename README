usage: tracebrk [-p <pid>] [-e <exe>] [-m] [-q] [-- <args...>]

  where pid is an existing process to attach to and exe is the path to the
  process' executable. If pid is not provided, exe must be given and the
  program will be executed with the given arguments.

tracebrk assists in locating memory leaks in Linux programs by identifying
allocations that result in the extension of a process' data segment, for
example when a brk-backed malloc cannot fulfill a request from its free list.
tracebrk attaches to a running process via ptrace and displays a backtrace any
time the brk syscall is invoked.

Note that malloc allocations may occur through mmap instead of brk; see
M_MMAP_THRESHOLD in mallopt(3) for more. Optionally via the -m flag, tracebrk
can also show a backtrace any time mmap is invoked to request an anonymous,
private mapping.

The -q flag causes the standard output and error of <exe> to not be closed,
though this is meaningless with -p.

trackbrk requires libunwind. If present, addr2line (part of binutils) will be
used to supplement function addresses with the source file and line numbers
read from the binary's debug symbols.

tracebrk has been tested only on x86_64 Linux, though i386 could be made to
work.
