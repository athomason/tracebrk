tracebrk assists in locating memory leaks in x86-64 Linux programs by
identifying memory allocations that result in the extension of a processes data
segment, for example when a brk-backed malloc cannot fulfill a request from its
free list. tracebrk attaches to a running process via ptrace and displays a
backtrace any time the brk syscall is invoked. Usual caveats of producing a
backtrace via libunwind apply; most importantly, the program should be compiled
with debugging symbols. Note that malloc allocations
